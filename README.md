# VVMA
Very Vulnerable Management API (VVMA) is an intentionally vulnerable RESTful API built with Node.js for educational and testing purposes. It is designed to help security professionals, developers, and learners understand and mitigate common API security risks. 
This API intentionally includes vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks, allowing users to explore and test security flaws in user and group management systems.

VVMA is a valuable resource for improving API security skills through hands-on practice and code analysis.

git clone https://github.com/abigailajohn/VVMA.git
cd VVMA
```

2. Start the services
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d 
```
This will start the API, database, and MailHog.

3. Check running containers
```bash
docker ps
```
API Base URL: http://localhost:3000, Swagger Docs: http://localhost:3000/api-docs & MailHog UI: http://localhost:8025


### Using Docker only
You can use the pre-built Docker image (but we recommend using docker-compose):

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abigailajohn/VVMA.git
cd VVMA
```

2. Start the services
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 abigaila11/vvma 
```

### Local Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abigailajohn/VVMA.git
cd VVMA
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up the database:
Import the pre-populated database:
   
```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p < src/db/init.sql
```

3. Start MailHog
